    "## About This Course:\n",
    "This course was designed to provide the building blocks for Python programming and data collection for those choosing a career in Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially conceived as a foundation course for Data Science and AI it has been refreshed several times to keep pace with emerging career options. Additional content has been added which is applicable to Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this course you will have learned foundational skills in Python programming which you can then go on to apply in the Python Project course for your chosen career.  The Python Project courses involve real world scenarios where you are in charge of a final project as a Data Scientist, a Data Engineer, or in AI and Application Development. By finishing this course and your follow-on Python Project, you will gain the basic skills to continue the steps on your chosen career path.\n",

    "## Course Syllabus:\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Week 1: Python Basics](#week1)\n",
    "- This module teaches the basics of Python and begins by exploring some of the different data types such as integers, real numbers, and strings. Continue with the module and learn how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and the many different ways to manipulate strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Week 2: Python Data Structures](#week2)\n",
    "- This module begins a journey into Python data structures by explaining the use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data in a single variable. Next learn about dictionaries and how they function by storing data in pairs of keys and values, and end with Python sets to learn how this type of collection can appear in any order and will only contain unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Week 3: Python Programming Fundamentals](#week3)\n",
    "- This module discusses Python fundamentals and begins with the concepts of conditions and branching. Continue through the module and learn how to implement loops to iterate over sequences, create functions to perform a specific task, perform exception handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Week 4: Working with Data in Python](#week4)\n",
    "- This module explains the basics of working with data in Python and begins the path with learning how to read and write files. Continue the module and uncover the best Python libraries that will aid in data manipulation and mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Wek 5: APIs and Data Collection](#week5)\n",
    "- This module delves into the unique ways to collect data by the use of APIs and webscraping. It further explores data collection by explaining how to read and collect data when dealing with different file formats."
